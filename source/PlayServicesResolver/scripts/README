The script generate_gradle_prebuild.py takes a set of android dependencies and,
using gradle, builds a merged pre-built proguard-stripped package in Eclipse /
Ant package format. This is primarily meant to be used to add Proguard support
within unity.

sample/sampledeps.json is a sample config passed to generate_gradle_prebuild.py.

The files in gradle_template.zip are not meant to be edited and are referenced
by the script to generate the gradle build.

Here's an example invocation of the script:

python generate_gradle_prebuild.py -c sample/sampledeps.json

By default the output is written to MergedDeps/ relative to the current working
directory and GenGradle/ contains the intermediate gradle build files.
Subsequent use of the same intermediate build directory will result in
incremental builds. These directories and other settings can be configured,
see python generate_gradle_prebuild.py -h for help.
